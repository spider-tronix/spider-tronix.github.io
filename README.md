### About Us

  > Spider, the Research and Development club of [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu), is a cluster of like-minded individuals pursuing projects in some of the booming technology sectors. The Tronix profile is a Spider division wherein we majorly work on the lines of Embedded Systems,  Electronics, IoT, Robotics and Simulation, Control Systems, Solid Modelling, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and many more. Apart from the R & D projects, we conduct a uCON (mu-CON) workshop exclusively for the first years of NIT Trichy every year. Generally, the workshop happens in the mid of the odd semester. Also, we conduct an event named CRE-8 in the middle of even semester every academic year exclusively for first years at college.

### Technologies

The portfolio uses a number of web development tech:

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is an open-source, free JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax

### Repository Info

* ```master``` branch has the source files for the React app.
* ```gh-pages``` branch has the files for production (hosting on Github Pages).

### Requirements
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) version same or greater than ```v12.8.2```.
- [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) version same or greater than ```v6.14.5```.

### Installation

- Clone the ```master``` branch on your local. 
- Change the directory(cd) to the local cloned directory. 
- Give command ```npm install```
- Finally, to start react-app give ```npm start```

```bash
$ git clone [Repo url]
$ cd spider-tronix.github.io
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
- Wait for some time and automatically, the browser should open with ```localhost:3000```. 

### Building

To build the app:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Also, the react-app is set to push the changes to ```gh-pages``` branch after building. Hence, with one command building plus deploying can be done. To do so:

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```
